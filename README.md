## What is DevOps?

DevOps is the process of continuously developing, integrating and deploying software by bridging the gap between traditional development and operations teams. DevOps engineers are responsible for solving problems in the software development lifecycle - generally through automating the processes of running tests, reporting problems and deploying code.

## Why DevOps?

Catching problems before they become a major problem is a massive economic advantage - whereas traditionally it might be unclear whether a bug occurred in the development or operations stage, using DevOps it can be dealt with almost immediately after it occurs, and thus software is deployed and integrated more frequently. DevOps also encourages greater collaboration across the business on the software lifecycle.

## Benefits of DevOps

- Collaboration
- Efficient deployment
- Optimisation of software development
- Improve the business value

## Four Pillars of DevOps

- Ease of use
- Flexible 
- Robust
- Cost-effective

## Virtualisation
In order to create deployment environments, we first need to learn about virtualisation, which we will do with VirtualBox and Vagrant. The below steps can be found in the [Documentation folder](./documentation/).

1. [Creating a Linux Ubuntu Virtual Machine](./documentation/1.starting_a_virtual_machine.md)
2. [Linux commands](./documentation/2.common_commands_in_virtual_machine.md)
3. [Permissions](./documentation/3.permissions_in_virtual_machine.md)
4. [Installing packages](./documentation/4.installing_packages_in_virtual_machine.md)
5. [Provisioning](./documentation/5.provisioning_a_virtual_machine.md)
6. [Environment Variables](./documentation/6.Enviroment%20Variables.md)
7. [Provisioning using Starter Code](./documentation/7.Provisioning_starter_code_and_running_tests.md)
