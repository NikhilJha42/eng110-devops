# Provisioning Starter-Code and running tests

## Provisioning starter-code

Create a file called `provisioning.sh` in the same directory as Vagrantfile. Then enter the following (note that `-y` automatically answers yes to commands where the machine would otherwise check):

- `#!/bin/bas` - this tells vagrant that this file should be run automatically when `vagrant up` is run;
- `sudo apt-get update -y` - This and the command below ensure Linux is fully updated.
- `sudo apt-get upgrade -y` - See above.
- `sudo apt-get install nginx -y` - installs nginx
- `sudo apt-get start nginx` - 
- `sudo apt-get enable nginx` - 
- `sudo apt-get install python-software-properties` - installs python dependency.
- `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -` - obtains the installation package for the correct version of `nodejs`
- `sudo apt-get install nodejs -y` - installs nodejs dependency.

Then add the following to the Vagrantfile:

- `config.vm.provision "shell", path: "provisioning.sh"`
