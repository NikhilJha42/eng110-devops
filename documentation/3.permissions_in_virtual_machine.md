### Permissions
- How to check permissions `ls -la`.
- The first four characters give a type (`-` for file, `d` for directory) and the read-write-execute permissions for the user (that is, yourself); so `-rwx` means that the resource is a file which the owner can read, write and execute (if the file is a script) and `----` is a file that the user cannot read, write or execute.
- How to switch to 'root user' `sudo su`
- How to change permissions `chmod instruction file_name`
- Instructions are given as a three digit number - since it's usually safest when changing permissions to allow only the user access, the list is as follows:
  - `000` - no permisions `---`
  - `100` - execute permission `--x`
  - `200` - write permission `-w-`
  - `300` - write and execute permissions `-wx`
  - `400` - read permission `r--`
  - `500` - read and execute permissions `r-x`
  - `600` - read and write permissions `rw-`
  - `700` - read, write and execute permissions `rwx`
- If you wanted to read and write the file, but anyone else to only read it, you could use the instruction `644`, for example.
- To leave administrator run `exit`.
